Thanks for the article. I actually posted a correction comment at the end of the thread. This is the best way I could work it up, just wish it was easier to drill done to the specific directory rather than filter it with conditional. That could get real laborious given really deep/nested directories. Either way, I think this is what you were saying about using the URL method.
