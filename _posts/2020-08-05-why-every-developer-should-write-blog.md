Regardless of skill level, whether you're a beginner programmer or a seasoned engineer, blogging can provide significant benefits to your and your career, and even to your followers. Aside from the potential idea of earning some extrac income, writing both technical and non-technical blogs can boost your skill.


## 1. Learn and Improve Technical Skills
It may seem counterintuitive to expect to learn about prgramming by writing about programming, but this to be the most applicable benefit of blogging. As the saying goes **<i>the best way to learn is to teach</i>** and this is certainly true for developers
 * When you publish a blog post for the world to see, it adds **presure** to make sure you know what you're talking about. No one wants to write something that shows they just don't get it, so the added **pressure** teaches you to dig deeper and think about what you're doing.
 * Explaining a concept is much more difficult than <i>"knowing"</i> it. You may be able to run some deep learning model instantly, but <span style="color:blue">writing about it</span> and explaining to others requires an in-depth understanding of what's actually going on .
 * Comments and interactions from viewers on our blog may force you to further explain and justify your ideas, which again requires more than just surface-level understanding of what you're writing about.


## 2. Get Feedback from Viewers
Getting feedbacks from viewers will be a fantastic benefit to blogging. As the saying goes <span style="color:orange"><b>Go alone if you want to go faster, Go together if your want to go farther</b></span>. Therefore, those feedbacks from viewers can act as a review of the concepts and implementations that you employ in your work, to further develop your skills and improve your source code.

## 3. Demonstrate Knowledge and Skills to Potential Employers
Just like a portfolio of projects that show off your work, blogging can be a way to really demostrate that you know what you're working on. Writing about something trully requires a deeply understand, and blog posts are a perfect chance to show this in-depth knowledge to the people who are looking for quality software engineer.
Currently, the recruiter will contact you through many SNS (social network service) like Github, LinkedIn in order to briefly verify that the candidate has the relevant experience for the position.

## 4. Improve Communications Skills
To be good at coding is not the only way to asure that you will reach higher in career
