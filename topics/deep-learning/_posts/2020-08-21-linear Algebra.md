The basic mathematical objects, arithmetic, and operations in linear algebra, expressing each of them through mathematical notation and the corresponding implementation in code

 * [Scalar](#scalar)
 * [Vector](#vector)



## Scalar
A scalar is represented by a tensor with hust one element.


## Vector
A vector is simply a list of scalar values. These values are called the *elements* (*entries* or *components*) of the vector.
